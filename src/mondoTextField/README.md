This repository contains the source and images for a MondoTextField.

A full explanation of the MondoTextField is available on the
[Cocoa Mondo Blog]
(http://sunflower.coleharbour.ca/cocoamondo/2008/12/the-mondotextfield-a-formal-introduction/).

There is also a sample XCode project in GitHub that uses this repository as a submodule.  
[http://github.com/mcormier/mondotextfield/tree/master]
(http://github.com/mcormier/mondotextfield/tree/master)

I've sectioned off the source and images into it's own repository so that it can be
more easily integrated into peoples projects.

To use a MondoTextField in your application do the following:

1. Add the images, source code, and xib to your project
2. Change any NSTextFields in your xibs and nibs to MondoTextFields
3. Link the labelTextField outlet to the appropriate label.
