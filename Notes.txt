How to make an ibplugin that opens up properly in 
Interface Builder when double clicked.
-------------------------------------------------
1. - Copy the dependent framework into 
*.ibplugin/Contents/Resources
2. - Clear the variable Dynamic Linking Install Name
[LD_DYLIB_INSTALL_NAME]

This will create an ibplugin that allows someone to
download and double click to use it immediately.  Otherwise the
plugin will not work unless a copy of the framework is
located in /Library/Frameworks/.
